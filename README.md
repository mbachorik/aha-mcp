# aha-mcp

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This repository is replaced by the hosted [Aha! remote MCP server](https://support.aha.io/aha-develop/integrations/mcp-server/remote-mcp-server~7611250482619899159) instead.
>
> The remote MCP server connects directly from your AI tool to `https://[your-aha-domain].aha.io/api/v1/mcp`, uses your Aha! permissions, and has broader capabilities, including creating and editing records. 

Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for accessing Aha! records through the MCP. This integration enables seamless interaction with Aha! features, requirements, and pages directly through the Model Context Protocol.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js v20 or higher
- npm (usually comes with Node.js)
- An Aha! account with API access

## Installation

### Using npx

```bash
npx -y aha-mcp@latest
```

### Manual Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/aha-develop/aha-mcp.git
cd aha-mcp

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the server
npm run mcp-start
```

## Authentication Setup

1. Log in to your Aha! account at `<yourcompany>.aha.io`
2. Visit [secure.aha.io/settings/api_keys](https://secure.aha.io/settings/api_keys)
3. Click "Create new API key"
4. Copy the token immediately (it won't be shown again)

For more details about authentication and API usage, see the [Aha! API documentation](https://www.aha.io/api).

## Environment Variables

This MCP server requires the following environment variables:

- `AHA_API_TOKEN`: Your Aha! API token
- `AHA_DOMAIN`: Your Aha! domain (e.g., yourcompany if you access aha at yourcompany.aha.io)

## IDE Integration

For security reasons, we recommend using your preferred secure method for managing environment variables rather than storing API tokens directly in editor configurations. Each editor has different security models and capabilities for handling sensitive information.

Below are examples of how to configure various editors to use the aha-mcp server. You should adapt these examples to use your preferred secure method for providing the required environment variables.

### VSCode

The instructions below were copied from the instructions [found here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers#_add-an-mcp-server).

Add this to your `.vscode/settings.json`, using your preferred method to securely provide the environment variables:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "aha-mcp": {
        "command": "npx",
        "args": ["-y", "aha-mcp"]
        // Environment variables should be provided through your preferred secure method
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Cursor

1. Go to Cursor Settings > MCP
2. Click + Add new Global MCP Server
3. Add a configuration similar to:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aha-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "aha-mcp"]
      // Environment variables should be provided through your preferred secure method
    }
  }
}
```

### Cline

Add a configuration to your `cline_mcp_settings.json` via Cline MCP Server settings:

      "args": ["-y", "aha-mcp"]
      // Environment variables should be provided through your preferred secure method
    }
  }
}
```

### RooCode

Open the MCP settings by either:

- Clicking "Edit MCP Settings" in RooCode settings, or
- Using the "RooCode: Open MCP Config" command in VS Code's command palette

Then add:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aha-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "aha-mcp"]
      // Environment variables should be provided through your preferred secure method
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Desktop

Add a configuration to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aha-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "aha-mcp"]
      // Environment variables should be provided through your preferred secure method
